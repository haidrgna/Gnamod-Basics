		<!-- World Only and/or Valmod Tweak -->
ot yet on github, this version is a simplified version of my mod that only mildly tweaks vanilla and adds my world to it. The Valmod Tweak does the same for Valmar's Valmod Overhaul. I am not yet sure we need to add these to the launcher so thats why I did not yet add them to github.

In this variation of Gnamod Ultra Nomad Mode the zombies will not climb, this mode is designed for people that like it a bit easier.

Gnamod Ultra Nomad Mode is a variation on Gnamod World where players start out with a randomized starting kit and have them survive as a nomad trekking around the world. In this mode building is severely limited and most construction is gated behind the workbench. This mode creates an unique challenging gameplay where you will move from location to location seeking shelter during the night and traveling during the day looking for valuables and food. This mode can be played solo, with friends and could even be used as a basis for a PvP server. World size is Small (5000 block radius).

In this variation of Gnamod Ultra Nomad Mode the amount of zombies spawned in the world will be increased, this version is meant for teams of up to 4 players or players seeking a challenge.

Gnamod Necropolis is a NEW RWG World created using the knowledge gained while working on Gnamod World and Ultra Nomad Mode. 
It creates an all new world that features a bleak and desolate post apocalyptic wasteland world. In this world you will not find 
any green biomes or places to hide. You find yourself in the remains of sprawling metropolis, a zone that is not consumed by the 
radiation that surrounds it. The weather has been affected and so have its inhabitants, which come out of their radiation 
hideouts at night to feed on any remaining survivors. 

Can you survive in this Wasteland?
